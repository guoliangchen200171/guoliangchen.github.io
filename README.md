# Resume üíºüè¢üíªüìÑüóÇüìéüóÑÔ∏èüè¶üì†üñáüñ®üì±üìß

You will utilize GitHub Pages to create a host your resume

## Part 1 - Instructions

You will have to create this project from scratch using plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

This website will include:

* At least four pages that you can navigate to, consider index, about me, projects, socials, bio, demo real, portfolio, etc.
* Have at least two interactive JavaScript components that alter the view but are also accessible with a keyboard. Consider a button to switch between light and dark mode themes, a switch to change languages from English to Spanish, something to change the font sizes, go to high contrast mode, etc.
* Include a professionally written, styled, and presented resume. Visit with the career services people to have them look it over.
* Create your own favicon.
* Publish your website onto GitHub Pages.

You can utilize open-source CSS, but it must be cited and adapted to your needs.

Be sure that you have:

* Validated your HTML using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure no errors nor warnings.

* Verify that you are well documenting your code using [JSDoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc) standards. You do not need to generate an API.
* Ensured that you write satisfactory unit tests and that your code passes them, with **75%** coverage for non-view related tests.
* Include View Testing with puppeteer to ensure your website is updating as expected.
* Test your color contrast by visiting [a11y.com](https://color.a11y.com/).

**Optional**:

Purchase a domain name for your site and link it to your GitHub pages. I've used Google Domains, recently purchased by SquareSpace, with usually costs $1 for a domain name such as [www.oscarveliz.com](www.oscarveliz.com) and it is always a good idea to at least grab your name before someone else does. See [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for more information on how to do this.

## Part 2 - Reflection

Add screenshots below showing,

* Your app running on GitHub Pages

* Your html validation
* Your code coverage
* Your view testing

Update the README to answer the following questions:

 1. Identify the interactive JavaScript elements of your website and explain how you implemented them.
  In my website,  The size of the word can increase or decrease. I use the javascript to add the number of frontsize or decrease the number of frontsize to achieve it.
  I also add the function that user can select the bright and dark model. During the javascript , I use a boolean cutton combine with the if-else to select different for background. 
 2. What specific feedback did the career services people give you about your resume?
  They told me that when i write the resume, I need focus on the my achievement and my impact instead of spend too many words on the team's result.
 3. What aspects of this project did you find particularly challenging and why? Explain how you overcame them.
  The most challenge for me to overcome is How to put my resume on the html. I search lots of information and use different size of word to imitate my printed resume and finish it.
 4. Explain how you created a custom favicon for your page.
  I draw on the pdf and then I make a png of my drawing and then i put the png picture in my project and make a link to achieve it.
 5. Write a short essay about what you've learned in this class so far. Think about all the technologies we've used, the activities you've done, the programs you've made, and how far you've come. Describe your experiences in at least 20 sentences with specific examples from this course.
  At the beginning of this course,We spend one week to study the knowledge of html and javascript which give us the foundation to develop web. Then we finish our first home work-temperature. We make a html web and use javascript to change the temperature we put in.
  Then we study the css which enable us to make the webpage become more pretty.
  In the 'pick your own api', I know how to fetch the information from the API and the address the information and how to combine the html with API to achieve strong function.
  In the 'simple server' I learned how to use the server to act on my homepage instead of operate my webpage on the local.
  The database is also very important for the web development, so I learn how to use mango DB and mangoose in the homework of 'mangoDB'!
  In the 'mocking pug' I learned how to use pug to produce html which make it become very convinent.
  In the 'heathrow', I learned how to use D-3 to visualized my view which is easier for people to watch.
  During the express project, I also learned how to cooperate with my teammates to finish the project and finish the authorization of the webpage. We finish a web page that the user can comment the happylemon.
